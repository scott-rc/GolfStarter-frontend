# GolfStarter-FrontEnd

Welcome Production 5!

Below I've laid out the instructions to get our frontend up and running.

## Required Software

Install any of the listed software below if you haven't already.

* [Git v2.14.1](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Node v6.11.3 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Frontend Setup

After the required software is installed, use the command prompt to clone this repository.

```
> git clone https://github.com/scott-rc/GolfStarter-frontend.git
```

Now, let's go into the newly cloned directory and use npm (Node Package Manager) to install our frontend dependencies.

```
> cd GolfStarter-frontend
> npm install
```

Finally let's build and start our frontend.

```
> npm run build
  ...
> npm run start
```

If you see

> Listening for requests on port 8080

Then code was compiled correctly and our frontend server is up and running!

Assuming you have the backend up and running, head over to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser to see the website!
